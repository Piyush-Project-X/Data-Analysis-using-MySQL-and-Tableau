Overview

COVID-19 Data Analysis project, a comprehensive initiative designed to leverage MySQL for data manipulation and Tableau for insightful visualizations. This project focuses on analyzing global COVID-19 data to uncover trends, patterns, and critical insights.

Problem Statement: Analyze global COVID-19 data to uncover trends and insights.

Solution Approach: Utilized MySQL for data management and advanced calculations, integrated datasets, and visualized insights using Tableau.

Skills Gained: Proficiency in SQL queries, data analysis, database management, and Tableau visualizations.




Project Goals

Database Creation and Management: Establish a structured database to store and manage COVID-19 data.

Data Exploration: Conduct extensive exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.

Advanced Calculations: Perform complex calculations to derive meaningful statistics.

Data Integration: Combine datasets to provide a holistic view of the data.

Visualization: Utilize Tableau to create dynamic and interactive visualizations for data presentation.

Database Setup

Creating and Using the Database
The project begins by creating a new database named portfolio_project and setting it up for subsequent operations. This ensures that all data manipulations and analyses are conducted within a structured environment.

Exploring Datasets

Two primary datasets are explored:

coviddeaths: Contains data on COVID-19 deaths worldwide.

covidvaccination: Contains data on COVID-19 vaccinations.


This project showcases the power of combining MySQL for data processing and Tableau for visualization to derive actionable insights from COVID-19 data. It demonstrates the ability to manage, analyze, and present complex data in a way that is both informative and visually appealing, making it a valuable addition to any data analysis and visualization portfolio.


The initial exploration involves selecting all columns and ordering the data to identify patterns and anomalies.
